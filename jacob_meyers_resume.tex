		\begin{cvsubsection}{Software Engineer}{Netflix}{August 2023 -- Present}
			\emph{Infrastructure API team; Network Services and Insights team}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Developed a 12 month strategy/roadmap for Netflix's public DNS infrastructure management.
				\item Implemented low-level DNS abstractions via Kubernetes Operators on top of Netflix's federated infrastructure API platform.
				\item Drove migration of public DNS zones from legacy vendors to AWS Route53. We migrated > 1 million queries per minute of volume with zero downtime/incidents. The migration saved Netflix \$1,000,000 per year.
				\item Built a load testing framework with Temporal to exercise high throughput Kubernetes requests to high cardinality Custom Resource collections.
